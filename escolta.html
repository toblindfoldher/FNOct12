            pass by. They were black, due to the dark rocks behind the stream
            and the murky tone of the water created a mysterious and lively
            black pool.

            praying to an unseen force. Forkmoss and feathermoss provide velvety
            whispers of gold, yellow and beige amidst the emeralds and jades.
